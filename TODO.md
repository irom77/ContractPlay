# ContractPlay roadmap

Completed checklist history is in [TODO-archive.md](TODO-archive.md).

Status follows the app-wide plan in [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-contractplay-app.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-25-contractplay-app.md).

## Current focus

The core rules, PBN package, and solo client are in place, and the solo app roadmap is complete. Beginner through Expert bots are selectable and differ in both bidding and card play: Beginner bids constructively and answers partner; Intermediate competes with overcalls, takeout doubles, and preempts; Advanced balances, reopens, opens light in third and fourth seat, draws trumps, and ruffs; Expert adds Gerber, splinters, Reverse Drury, Lebensohl, and counts winners in the play. SAYC and 2/1 share one agreement layer that reads every auction from the opening bid, with separate responses where the systems differ. Switchable hints suggest a call or card with a reason and explain the meaning of calls. The Cloudflare deployment serves the web app and online tables together at https://contractplay.niuk.workers.dev; the old GitHub Pages copy is no longer updated. Next is confirming the deployment with a real game and moving to `bridge.romaniuk.us`; then sign-in, permissions, and invitations.

## Hand records and replays

Solo PBN board sets against the field shipped on 2026-11-13 (see [TODO-archive.md](TODO-archive.md)). Research: `docs/research/2026-11-13-hand-record-archives.md`; plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-13-pbn-board-sets-vs-field.md`. Code: `packages/core/src/field.ts` (comparison), `packages/pbn/src/pbn.ts` (`ScoreTable`, inheritance, `pbnBoardToRecord`), `packages/persistence` (`BoardSet`, `HandRecord`), `apps/client/src/boardSet.ts`, `apps/client/src/table/FieldResult.tsx`, and the board-set flow in `apps/client/src/App.tsx`.


## Bots

- [ ] Allow players to configure bot aggressiveness levels (Conservative, Normal, Aggressive), alongside skill and bidding style, in solo settings and when creating an online table.

## Online multiplayer

- [ ] Repeat the two-window check on the deployed address and confirm the Workers free-plan CPU limit holds for bot decisions (if not, the paid Workers plan is the owner's decision).
- [ ] Set up `bridge.romaniuk.us` as the public address for online multiplayer. A CNAME at Squarespace will not work; a Workers custom domain needs the zone on Cloudflare. Steps for the owner: add `romaniuk.us` to Cloudflare (Free plan) and check the imported records, especially email (MX, TXT); switch the name servers in Squarespace Domains to the two Cloudflare gives (registration stays at Squarespace); once active, add `bridge.romaniuk.us` under Workers & Pages → `contractplay` → Settings → Domains & Routes → Custom domain. Then record the custom domain in `apps/server` wrangler configuration so deploys keep it.
- [ ] Add sign-in (authentication) so a seat and hand history follow a person across devices.
- [ ] Add permissions (authorization) beyond the current host and seated-player rules.
- [ ] Add invitations to a table.
- [ ] Add basic optional voice and video chat for players at a table.

## Production readiness

- [ ] Add abuse controls for online tables beyond the per-address limits (for example reporting, blocking, rate limits on table actions, and name moderation).
- [ ] Add accessibility review, security controls, observability, backups, and release automation.
- [ ] Complete cross-platform regression checks and release runbooks.
